									<p>
										Recently, an enormous shift has been witnessed from Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to Internet of Vehicles (IoV).
										However, there are certain challenges associated with such vision-based driver support systems such as latency issues due to sharing of duplicate information which compromises the accuracy of object detection, non-optimal deployment of Roadside Units (RSUs), and security breach.
										Motivated by these issues, this project was undertaken and we proposed an upgraded RSU placement method, an enhanced and accurate object detection mechanism, and a secure technique for data sharing in an IoV system. The details of the work implemented have been presented below.
